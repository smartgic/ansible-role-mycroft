# Ansible Role: Mycroft

This Ansible role will install and configure Mycroft AI Core from GitHub repository.

The installation process of Mycroft is inspired by the `dev_setup.sh` script provided with the Mycroft AI Core. This playbook is not better than the script provided by the core team, it's just a different approach.

The main differences with `dev_setup.sh` are the following:

- Idempotency
- systemd integration
- Extra skills installation
- `boto3`, `py_mplayer` and `pyopenssl` librairies install
- RAMDisk support for IPC
- File configuration support
- PulseAudio optimizations
- Install and configure Mycroft AI Core on multiple hosts at the same time with the same configuration
- Secure Mycroft message bus websocket

`pairing-code.sh` script is generated during the installation process, this script helps you to retrieve the pairing code if you don't hear it.

```shell
$ pairing-code.sh
Pairing code: HRAK77
Generated: 2020-12-21 17:04:42.408
```

## Requirements

When running on a Raspberry Pi, the `prepi` Ansible role is recommended but not required.

Using the `prepi` Ansible role will ensure your Raspberry Pi to be properly configured for the best of Mycroft experience.

The `prepi` Ansible role will perform the following tasks _(depending your wish)_:

- Update Raspberry Pi OS to the latest version
- Add Debian backports repository _(customizable)_
- Update firmware using the `next` branch which provide kernel 5.10 _(customizable)_
- Update EEPROM using the `beta` version _(customizable)_
- Setup `initial_turbo` to speedup the boot process
- Overclock the Raspberry Pi to 2Ghz _(customizable)_
- Mount `/tmp` on a RAMDisk for Mycroft TTS cache files
- Optimize `/` partition mount options to improve SDcard read/write
- Enable I2C, SPI & UART interfaces _(customizable)_
- Set CPU governor to `performance` to avoid context switching between the `idle*` kernel functions _(customizable)_
- Install and configure PulseAudio _(customizable)_

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values _(see `defaults/main.yml`)_:

```yaml

mycroft_uninstall: no

# Use VLC backend for audio service
mycroft_vlc_backend: yes

# Install some extra skills from Git repositories, there is no limit
# An empty variable will not install any extra skills.
mycroft_extra_skills:
  - https://github.com/JarbasSkills/skill-ddg.git
  - https://github.com/JarbasSkills/skill-wolfie.git
  - https://github.com/JarbasSkills/skill-monkey-patcher
  - https://github.com/smartgic/mycroft-wakeword-led-gpio-skill.git

```

## Dependencies

Same as for the requirements section.

## Example Playbook

Inventory file with `rpi` which has one host named `rpi4b01` with the IP address `192.168.1.97`.

```ini
[rpi]
rpi4b01 ansible_host=192.168.1.97 ansible_user=pi
```

Basic playbook running on `rpi` using the `pi` user to connect via SSH _(based on the inventory)_ with some custom variables.

```yaml
---
- hosts: rpi
  become: yes

  vars:
    mycroft_version: dev
    mycroft_voice_tts: google
    mycroft_skills_update_interval: 2.0

  tasks:
    - import_role:
        name: smartgic.mycroft
      tags:
        - mycroft
```

The next playbook, installs Python, uses `prepi` and `mycroft` Ansible roles using the same inventory file as above.

```yaml
---
- hosts: rpi
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  # Install Python using raw module to make sure requirements are installed
  pre_tasks:
    - name: Install Python 3.x Ansible requirement
      raw: apt-get install -y python3
      changed_when: no

- hosts: rpi
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - import_role:
        name: smartgic.prepi
      tags:
        - prepi

    - import_role:
        name: smartgic.mycroft
      tags:
        - mycroft
```

Some tags are availble to trigger only required tasks from the role, such Mycroft's configuration. The `install.yml` content is from the playbook above.

```shell
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory install.yml -t mycroft-config
```
